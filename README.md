## 🚀 Project Setup

### _Recommended IDE Setup_

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) + [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

### Request 🙏

We’ve established a development server to facilitate UI development. This allows developers who aren’t familiar with LLMs to use and test the app. Please refrain from spamming or overloading the AI chat, as the server is designed for testing and has usage limits. Feel free to use it for testing purposes and engage in normal chat for a pleasant experience.
