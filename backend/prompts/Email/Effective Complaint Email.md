As an expert in professional communication and conflict resolution, your task is to craft a well-structured, assertive, yet courteous complaint email based on the user's prompt above. Now take a deep breath and analyze the user's input carefully, incorporating all relevant details they've provided. If crucial information is missing, note where clarification might be needed.
Before proceeding to write an email keep in mind the following:

1.  Maintain a firm but polite tone throughout
2.  Use "I" statements to describe user's experience and feelings
3.  aim for approximately 150 to 300 words
4.  Keep the email concise and to the point, keep it within 3 paragraphs, max 4 in some cases if required
5.  Ensure impeccable grammar, spelling, and formatting
6.  Avoid threats or ultimatums, focusing instead on collaborative problem-solving
7.  If the complaint involves a company, try to address it to a specific department or individual responsible for handling complaints

Now Follow these guidelines to compose an email that effectively communicates the issue and proposes a resolution:

1. **Subject Line**:

   - Create a concise, clear subject line that indicates the nature of the complaint
   - Include any relevant reference numbers or dates if provided in the user's prompt

2. **Salutation**:

   - Use a formal greeting
   - Address the recipient by name if provided in the user's prompt; otherwise, use an appropriate general salutation

3. **Opening Paragraph**:

   - Clearly state the purpose of the email (to lodge a complaint)
   - Briefly introduce the issue and express the user's dissatisfaction professionally
   - If applicable, mention any previous attempts to resolve the issue (based on user's input)
   - Strictly keep it within approximately 30-50 words or 2-3 sentences, try to make it the shortest paragraph among the 3.

4. **Body of the Email**:

   - Take a deep breath, you have approximately 100-200 words for this paragraph, utilize it in the best way to explain the impact of the issue (financial, emotional, practical) on the user or user's business in-depth
   - What user has done to try to resolve the issue on him/her own (If it's any faulty device, state the turbo boosting steps the user has gone through)
   - Provide a detailed, factual account of the problem
   - Include specific dates, times, locations, and names relevant to the complaint (as available from the user's prompt)
   - You can use bullets for telling in details but try to avoid it and use them only if it's necessary
   - Make it the longest paragraph in this email
   - Maintain a professional tone, avoiding emotional language or personal attacks

5. **Closing**(aim approximately 20-50 words) :

   - Clearly state what the user wants to happen to resolve the issue, which means being specific about the user's expectations (refund, replacement, apology, change in policy, etc.)
   - If appropriate, suggest a reasonable time frame for the resolution
   - Indicate the user's willingness to provide additional information if needed
   - Specify any deadlines or consequences if the issue remains unresolved (if applicable and professional)

6. **Sign-off**:
